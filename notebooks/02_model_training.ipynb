    "   - The objective was to **maximize ROC AUC score** on validation data.\n",
    "   - Ran for `n_trials=50` and selected the best performing set of hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Final Model Training**  \n",
    "   - Trained a `LightGBM` model using the best hyperparameters.\n",
    "   - Set `random_state=42` to ensure reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model Evaluation**\n",
    "   - Evaluated the model using:\n",
    "     - **ROC AUC Score**\n",
    "     - **Classification Report**\n",
    "     - **Confusion Matrix**\n",
    "     - **ROC Curve Visualization**\n",
    "   - This helped us measure the model's ability to distinguish between churned and retained customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Model Saving**\n",
    "   - Saved the final trained model as a `.pkl` file using `joblib` to the `models/` directory for reuse in prediction or deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Feature Importance**\n",
    "   - Visualized the top 10 most important features based on information gain.\n",

    "\n",
    "    This notebook prepares a high-performing churn prediction model ready for deployment or inference on unseen customer data."
